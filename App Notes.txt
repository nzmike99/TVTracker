BUGS
====

- Why do controls that are less than 720 wide look too big on phone screen?

- Cast and crew dialog is way too big on phone screen (too wide)

- App crashed on phone when selecting Veep (after adding it in a previous execution) when trying to update the show.
  It did say the show had been updated but then crashed after that.
  


TO DO
=====

- Add icons!!!

- Work on layout
  - On a larger screen hub section should use all width wisth with each section equal width but also with a min width.
  - On phone screen a single hub section needs to take the full width (or just less, like the pivot control?)

- Think about swapping the show details and episode hub sections as the main interaction is with the episodes not the details.

- Refactor to store show details in DB as it's too slow when changing shows (TEST PERFORMANCE BEFORE DOING THIS?!?!?)

- Change main shows list to a Semantic Zoom?

- Add search to main shows 
  - Will need to change All Shows to use the ColelctionViewSource so it can be filtered)

- Implement the collapsible Expander control for the episodes section
  - When user clicks the header checkbox (Watched) need to update the DB - but ask user first?

- On phone version when a show is selected need to focus either the show details or the episodes hubsection

- Need to get progress ring working anywhere it is slow (like adding new shows, getting cast details, etc)
